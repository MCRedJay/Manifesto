Manifesto
=========

How software startups should operate.



Meetings
========

- All Meetings are optional, and open door.  This encourages brevety, and transparency.
  - Long term planning is open to all stakeholders.
  - The only exception are specific personnel issues.  

Geography
=========

- Startups are high risk.  They shouldn't be "all in" propositions, and at the same time, there are more intelligent people that don't live where you are than tehre are right here.  So, hire globall, build a distributed team.  Your employees are allowed to work wherever makes them happiest and most productive.  

Hiring
======

- Hire people who have that spark in their eyes.
  - hungry: they must have an agenda of some sort, preferably aligned with the companies interests in some way
    - self-teaching: training costs two people's time, and is less effective than those who want to learn (that said, training should happen)
    - ready to do whatever is needed.  "That's not my job" is never something they'd say.
    - look for people who have accomplished something exceptional, even if it's mundane.  eg: an exceptional train set.
    - only hire programmers who program because thats the way their brain formed. don't hire those who decided in college that it was a lucrative career
    - find people who enjoy helping others. the guy who always volunteers to chip in, have that person interview each candidate to find people who think first of the team, and of themselves second
    - hire slowly, contract with potential hires at a high hourly rate, if they work out bring them on full time. (there's a special place in hell for people who do contract-to-hire at regular salary)

Firing
======

  - people have one boss, that is there manager. their manager must be competent in the work that they do
  - termination should never be a surprise, it should be the ultimate result of a series of attempts to correct problems

Work Day
========

- Software development requires mental acuity.  People should work when they are well rested.  Fixed schedules undermine productivity in software. 
- interrupting engineers, especially by management when the building is not on fire is a firing offense
  
Planning
========

- Choose one: Maximum productivity or hitting specific dates.  
- Choose one: The product you want, or the product you think you want at the beginning of the project.
  
  - Maximum productivity requires working on what's most important at the time when you have maximum information and focus. 
  
  - Dates always force a compromise to the product, and undermine productivity, because they cause corners to be cut to make the date.
  
  - At the same time, understanding of the market and the market itself can shift during product development.  You can't know in advance what the product will be with sufficient detail to schedule it out in advance.  And without that detail your date is arbitrary and counter-productive.
  
- On the other hand, real artists ship. 
  
- The compromise: Always be shipping.
  
  - Measure progress on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. Any more frequently and you're going to be interfering with productivity in order to have something new to report each day.
  
  
Fund Raising
============
- Don't do it unless you have to.  Prefer equity free sources:  Kickstarter, government programs, loans, Friends & Family, bootstrapping, roughing it, over taking money. Taking money from an investor should be the last resort, not the first.
- There are four stages to a company:  WTF? PRoduct, Traction, Grwoth.  Investments are best in the growth stage, while al ittle money in Traction can be ok.  Get from idea to product without giving up equity and you have a good chance of making it out alive.
- Biggest danger in fund raising is destroying the company. Investors (particularly in the bay area) are incentivized by "go big or go home" attitude. They would rather a 1 in a billion shot at a billion dollar company than a 1 in 10 shot at a 10 million dollar company.  Rationally the former is worth $1 while the latter is worth $1 million.  This means they will force you to bet it all, all teh time.  It's like playing Texas Holdem with someone elses money and he makes you go all in every hand. 
- In every round, take money off of the table.  Two reaosns for this: 1) it allows founders to focus on teh long term value of the company and not be tempted to sell by the fact that tehy can't afford ramen.  2) It's a good litmus test for investors.  Bad investors won't agree to this becauset tehy want a liquidity even for the whole company.
- Never make a specific decision simply because an investor made an investmetn dependant on it.  This is another litmus test.  Investors have the right to have an opinion about traction, valuation and the like.  Not specific prodcut or company choices, though they can provide feedback.
- All shareholders participate equally. ALL.  Investor money is no more valuable than sweat equity.  Deals should be short and sweet without a lot of rachets, double dipping and boiler plate that puts the company and the founders over a barrel.
