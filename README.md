Manifesto
=========

How software startups should operate.



Meetings
========

  All Meetings are optional, and open door.  This encourages brevety, and transparency.
    The only exception are specific personnel issues.  Long term planning must be open to all stakeholders.

Hiring
======

  Hire people who have that spark in their eyes.
    - hungry: they must have an agenda of some sort, preferably aligned with the companies interests in some way
    - self-teaching: training costs two people's time, and is less effective than those who want to learn
    - ready to do whatever is needed.  "That's not my job" is never something they'd say.
    - look for people who have accomplished something exceptional, even if it's mundane.  eg: an exceptional train set.
    - only hire programmers who program because thats the way their brain formed. don't hire those who decided in college that it was a lucerative career
    - find people who enjoy helping others. the guy who always volunteers to chip in, have that person interview each candidate to find people who think first of the team, and of themselves second
    - hire slowly, contract with potential hires at a high hourly rate, if they work out bring them on full time. (there's a special place in hell for people who do contract-to-hire at regular salary)

Work Day
========

  Software development requires mental qcuity.  People should work when they are well rested.  Fixed schedules undermine productivity in software. 
  
Planning
========

  Choose one: Maximum productivity or hitting specific dates.  
  Choose one: The product you want, or the product you think you want at the beginning of the project.
  
  Maximum productivity requires working on what's most important at the time when you have maximum information and focus. 
  
  Dates always force a compromise to the product, and undermine productivity, because they cause corners to be cut to make the date.
  
  At the same time, understanding of the market and the market itself can shift during product development.  You can't know in advance what the product will be with sufficient detail to schedule it out in advance.  And without that detail your date is arbitrary and counter-productive.
  
  On the other hand, real artists ship. 
  
  The compromise: Always be shipping.
  
  Measure progress on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. Any more frequently and you're going to be interfering with productivity in order to have something new to report each day.
