Manifesto
=========

How software startups should operate.



Meetings
========

  All Meetings are optional, and open door.  This encourages brevety, and transparency.
    The only exception are specific personnel issues.  Long term planning must be open to all stakeholders.

Hiring
======

  Hire people who have that spark in their eyes.
  - hungry: they must have an agenda of some sort, preferably aligned with the companies interests in some way
  - self-teaching: training costs two people's time, and is less effective than those who want to learn
  - ready to do whatever is needed.  "That's not my job" is never something they'd say.
  - look for people who have accomplished something exceptional, even if it's mundane.  
  -   Hire the guy who built a computer from scratch over the guy with a PHD in computer science.
